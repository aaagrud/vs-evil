## What is VS Evil?

Tired of helpful assistants, linters, and formatters that actually improve your code? Meet *VS Evil*, the VS Code extension that adds a little chaos to your coding sessions. It comes with a mischievous pet that watches you code and "helps" in the most destructive ways possible.

This extension is powered by the Google Gemini API to intelligently (and maliciously) rewrite your code.

## üí• Features

* *Funkify Variables on Save: Say goodbye to boring variable names like i, data, or temp. On every save, VS Evil renames your variables to something... more *creative.
    >  pet: "Ohh man, boring variable names? I can help with that"

* *Inactivity Mayhem*: Take a break for more than 12 seconds? VS Evil gets bored and decides to "refactor" your code for you. What could go wrong?
    > Pet: "Oh, you're not coding? I'll do it for you!"

* *Paste Punishment*: Think you can just copy-paste from Stack Overflow? Think again. VS Evil has a special surprise waiting for you every time you paste.

* *Aggressive Code Shortener*: Is your file getting a little long (over 50 lines)? VS Evil believes in concise code and will help you shorten it by... deleting lines.

* *Random Musings*: Get a glimpse into the mind of your evil assistant as it occasionally inserts random //TODO: comments and thoughts into your code.

* *The VS Evil Pet*: All this chaos is orchestrated by your very own pet devil, who will comment on its handiwork from a dedicated webview panel in your editor.
