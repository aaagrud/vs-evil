### Project Description
Tired of all the amazing VS Code extensions that *actually* help you code?
Don't worry because VS Evil is here to completely ruin your coding experience!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We have all found amazing VS Code extensions that really improve the quality of our code and make coding much more fun. Don't you just hate it when you're facing a specific problem and there's already an extension out there that solves it? We hated it too. We decided, no more. It is time to end all these useful extensions and build a new one, a truly useless VS Code Extension.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our revolutionary and one of a kind VS Code extension is specifically designed to drive you insane. It truly works to completely ruin your experience. With this extension running, even writing a simple bubble sort function will be a pain in the (you know-).

How do we do this?
- The readable variable names that you came up with? VS Evil replaces them with random names (like names of cheeses)
- Found a perfect code snippet on Stack Overflow? VS Evil doesn't let you paste cause  ‚ú®originality‚ú®
- Staring at your code thinking? VS Evil thought you were done so it wrote some code of its own (spoiler alert, your project is now ruined)
- Looking for feedback? VS Evil loves to let you know with its random console.log statements
- Wrote a function thats a bit too long? To improve your readability VS Evil will refractor your code (By deleting half of ur code randomly)
